At the moment, validation error messages from the associated models are not bubbled up to the main
model.  This means that if you rely on using :error_messages_for in your views then no errors from 
the associated models will not be displayed.

I'm not sure what the best way of reporting these errors.  SHould there be one error to say that there is
something wrong with the associated model or should all the individual errors be bubbled up?
